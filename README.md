# REST Server API Project

This project includes a REST Server that holds the last 5 years of stock records for three companies from IEXCloud. I implemented my own REST requests which then a java gui uses to make a user-friendly interface for the rest requests. This was a group project in which I was the team lead. I also did the database design and created our REST apis. The group focused on the GUI.
